<br/>

## Project Reports
 - [Preliminary Design Report][12]

<br/>

## Software
----

Primary file: "DynaSaRR.ino"
<br/><br/>

### Required Software: 
  - [Arduino][3]\*
  - [Teensyduino][4]
<br/><br/>
### Recommended Software:
  - [GitHub Desktop][7]
  - [Visual Studio Code][2]
  - [T6Config and Driver][1]
<br/><br/>

\* Note that as of 4/16/19 Teensyduino does not work with Arduino 1.8.9. You must install Arduino 1.8.8, then install Teensyduino and it should work. [This link][13] takes you to install previous versions of Arduino. And [this link][3] let's you install the current version of Arduino. Also note that only one version can be installed at a time.
<br/><br/>

### Software Setup:
 - Install [Arduino][3].
 - Install [Teensyduino][4].
 - Create a [GitHub][9] account.
 - [Send Sam][8] your GitHub username to contribute to the code. Here's the [link for Sam][6] to add collaborators.
 - Download and install [GitHub Desktop][7].
 - Download and install [Git][10].
 - Go to the [Repo][11] > "Clone or Download" > "Open in Desktop" (Will open in GitHub Desktop application)> Save the repo to a folder on your computer (this will not move in the future). 
 - Open code to edit in Arduino editor (or Visual Studio Code).
 - Always "push" your code at the end of your programming session! Otherwise no one can see your code changes and if something happens to your computer, the code is lost forever.
 - In GitHub Desktop at the end of your Arduino session, "Commit to master" (to locally save all new changes to the version history) then "Push origin" to upload the code to GitHub.
<br/><br/>
### Helpful Git terms:
 - Repo = repository: the folder of all of the files in the project.
 - Push = Push all local branch commits to the repository branch on the GitHub servers.
 - Commit = Record snapshot of files in repository (permanently available in version history). 
 - Pull = Download and incorporate changes.
